# ComfyUI Prompt Formatter

This is a custom node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that provides tools to clean, optimize, and format text prompts. It includes features like converting tags, aligning brackets, and applying weights to prompts.

## About

This project is a direct equivalent of [sd_extension-prompt_formatter](https://github.com/younyokel/sd_extension-prompt_formatter) but specifically designed for ComfyUI. This project is a fork of [uwidev's sd_extension-prompt_formatter](https://github.com/uwidev/sd_extension-prompt_formatter).

## Features

### Prompt Formatter Nodes:

- *CLIP Text Encode (Prompt Formatter)*: Equivalent to ComfyUI's `CLIP Text Encode`.
- *Prompt Formatter (Only Text)*: Same as above, but returns `STRING` instead of `CONDITIONING`.

These nodes feature the following buttons:

#### üí´ Format Prompt
A "magic button" that optimizes the text in the input field:
- Removes mismatched brackets (`()`, `[]`).
- Aligns commas, brackets, and spacing for better consistency.
- Applies weights to bracketed text (e.g., `((word))` might become `(word:1.21)` if `BRACKET2WEIGHT` is enabled in `config.json`).
- Removes duplicate tags within the prompt.

#### ‚úíÔ∏è Convert Tags
Converts **Danbooru-style tags** (e.g., `tag_name` with underscores) into a standard **comma-separated format** (e.g., `tag name,`), considering the `CONV_SPACE_UNDERSCORE` setting in `config.json` and filtering based on `blacklisted_tags.txt`.

#### ‚è™ Undo Last Change
Reverts the *last action* (either Format Prompt or Convert Tags) performed using the buttons on that specific node instance.

### Append String Node:

This node appends a second string (`string2`) to a first string (`string1`), with following options:
- `comma`: Add a comma and space between the combined strings.
- `dedupe`: Prevent adding tags from `string2` if they already exist in `string1`.

## Configuration Options

The behavior of the formatter can be customized using the `config.json` file. Below are the available options:

| **Option**              | **Description**                                                                 | **Values**                     | **Default**          |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------|
| `BRACKET2WEIGHT`         | Converts multiple brackets into weights.                                        | `true`, `false`                | `true`               |
| `CONV_SPACE_UNDERSCORE`  | Controls space/underscore conversion.                                           | `"None"`, `"Spaces to underscores"`, `"Underscores to spaces"` | `"None"` |
| `BLACKLIST_FILE`         | Path to the file containing blacklisted tag patterns.                           | String (file path)             | `"blacklisted_tags.txt"` |

## Blacklist Format

The blacklist file (`blacklisted_tags.txt`) contains **regular expression patterns** to filter out unwanted tags during the conversion process. Each line can include multiple patterns separated by spaces.

### Example Blacklist:
```
tagme .*text .*bubble onomatopoeia dialogue
.*(artwork) watermark signature 20\d\d
```

Patterns are compiled as regular expressions. Tags matching these patterns will be excluded during tag conversion.
